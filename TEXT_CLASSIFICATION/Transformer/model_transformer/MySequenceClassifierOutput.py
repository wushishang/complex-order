    """
    Base class for outputs of sentence classification models.

    Args:
        loss (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`(1,)`, `optional`, returned when :obj:`labels` is provided):
            Classification (or regression if config.num_labels==1) loss.
        logits (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`(batch_size, config.num_labels)`):
            Classification (or regression if config.num_labels==1) scores (before SoftMax).
        hidden_states (:obj:`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, `optional`, returned when ``output_hidden_states=True`` is passed or when ``config.output_hidden_states=True``):
            Tuple of :obj:`torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer)
            of shape :obj:`(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (:obj:`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, `optional`, returned when ``output_attentions=True`` is passed or when ``config.output_attentions=True``):
            Tuple of :obj:`torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape :obj:`(batch_size, num_heads,
            sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
        pooler_output (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`(batch_size, hidden_size)`):
            Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) after further processing
            through the layers used for the auxiliary pretraining task. E.g. for BERT-family of models, this returns
            the classification token after processing through a linear layer and a tanh activation function. The linear
            layer weights are trained from the next sentence prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.
